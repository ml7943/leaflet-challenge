# USGS Earthquake Data Visualization

This project is a data visualization tool for earthquake data using Leaflet and D3.js. It utilizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to visualize earthquake events on a map, including their location, magnitude, and depth. The project also includes geographic data for tectonic plate boundaries to help users gain a better understanding of earthquake distribution.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the earthquake data visualization.

## Features

This earthquake data visualization tool includes the following features:

- Plotting earthquake events from the past week on the map, using different colors and radii to represent magnitude and depth.

- Displaying a legend to explain the meaning of earthquake event colors and depth.

- Allowing users to switch between different basemap layers, including "Street Map" and "Satellite Map."

- Enabling users to toggle earthquake event layer and tectonic plate layer on and off in the layer control.

- Styling the tectonic plate layer with red lines to indicate boundaries.

## Data Sources

The earthquake data is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and can be found at the following URL: [USGS Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)

The tectonic plate geographic data is sourced from the following URL: [Tectonic Plate Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_plates.json)

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries and technologies:

- Leaflet.js: Used for creating interactive maps.
- D3.js: Used for data visualization.
- USGS Earthquake Data: Used for fetching earthquake event data.
- Tectonic Plate Geographic Data: Used for drawing tectonic plate boundaries.
